#  Circuit Simulator using Nodal Analysis

A Python-based circuit simulator that can solve any electrical circuit containing an arbitrary number of resistors, capacitors, inductors, voltage sources, and current sources using **nodal analysis**.
This project is designed to help students, hobbyists, and engineers analyze complex electrical networks efficiently.
